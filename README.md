# JOBWARS

  This repository is a job platform where the user puts it skills and the company post jobpost with their required
  skills and the program creates matchmaking between them. 
  
  I have won three business competitions with that project.
  
  The app is written in Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL, Knex and Bookshelf, Angular2, Boostrap.
  
  It is deployed in Heroku:
  [JobWars](https://jobwars.herokuapp.com)
  
  To use it, you must run:
  ```
    npm install
  ```
  
  And also add connection.js file where you create instances of knex and bookshelf
  with you db configuration.
